# Delivery-Operations-Performance
Delivery Operations Performance Dashboard analyzing order volume, rider efficiency, traffic impact, and operational bottlenecks using Power BI.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes delivery operations performance using order-level data, rider activity, weather conditions, traffic levels, and city categories.
The dashboard provides a complete operational view of delivery efficiency, workload distribution, and environmental impact on delivery time.

It highlights performance across:
* Total order volume
* Delivery efficiency metrics
* Rider productivity
* Weather & traffic impact
* City and vehicle performance
* Order type distribution

# Project Objectives
* Analyze total delivery volume and operational workload.
* Evaluate average delivery time across different conditions.
* Measure rider productivity and workload balance.
* Identify operational bottlenecks caused by traffic or weather.
* Understand performance differences between cities and vehicle types.
* Provide actionable recommendations to improve delivery efficiency.

# Dataset Description
The dataset combines operational delivery records including:

* Order ID
* Delivery Person ID
* City Category (Urban, Semi-Urban, Metropolitan)
* Order Type (Snack, Meal, Drinks, Buffet)
* Vehicle Type (Motorcycle, Bicycle, Scooter, Electric Scooter)
* Weather Conditions
* Traffic Level
* Delivery Time (Minutes)

The dataset enables operational analysis, efficiency monitoring, and performance benchmarking.

# Tools
* Power BI Desktop
* Power Query
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* Excel
* GitHub Hosting

# Insights
* Average delivery time increases significantly during Fog and Cloudy conditions, while Sunny weather shows the lowest delay.
* Traffic congestion (High & Jam levels) has a major impact on delivery time compared to Low traffic.
* Semi-Urban cities contribute the highest percentage of delivery time distribution (~40%), indicating operational pressure.
* Order volume is almost evenly distributed across order types (Snack, Meal, Drinks, Buffet), showing balanced demand.
* Vehicle type impacts efficiency motorcycles and electric scooters generally perform faster than bicycles.

# Data Storytelling Framework
* From a high-level perspective, delivery operations maintain stable workload distribution across order types and riders.
* However, environmental and traffic factors create operational bottlenecks that directly affect average delivery time.
* Urban density and traffic congestion appear to be the main performance drivers, while vehicle selection influences efficiency under different conditions.

# Recommendations
* Optimize rider allocation during high traffic periods.
* Increase usage of faster vehicle types in congested areas.
* Implement dynamic routing systems based on real-time traffic conditions.
* Monitor weather-based delays and adjust estimated delivery times proactively.
* Balance workload across city categories to reduce semi-urban pressure.

# Conclusion
* Improving operational flexibility and traffic-aware planning will significantly reduce average delivery time and enhance overall service quality.
* A data-driven approach to rider allocation and vehicle optimization will strengthen delivery performance and scalability.
